This is a microcontroller driven signal source, used to extend the operating frequencies of the VK3YNG foxhunt sniffer.

The main components of this system are:
* STM32 Nuleo32 board (I used the L432KC) 
* Silabs Si4464 transciever chip
* ADE-1 mixer
* 3.3VDC boost converter suppled by 2x AA/LR6 batteries
